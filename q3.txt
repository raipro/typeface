We will try to store data in the form of 100*1000 matrix(call this storage,error percentage)
storage[i][j] denotes average response time corresponding to ith API called by jth user
error percentage[i][j] denotes error percentage of each API(calculated by refreshing total number of failed and accepted requests in an hour)
function 1:
iterate through storage to find maximum among all the values and find corr. API
function 2:
Iterate through columns and find corresponding max in each row
function3: error percentage
